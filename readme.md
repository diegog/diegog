Hey, I'm Diego! I am a software engineer currently working remotely at a fintech company that specializes in B2B commerce based out of San Francisco, California. When I am not coding, you will find me in the mountains!

I have been programming for 8+ years and have 3 years of professional work experience as a software engineer. I specialize in complex backend systems, but am comfortable working with full-stack development and love learning about new technology/concepts. I am also a huge proponent of creating CI/CD pipelines early on in the development process so that I can spend more time developing rather than building and deploying.

I am a ski bum at heart, so you will find me in the mountains skiing most of the winter. When skiing isn't possible I will still be taking advantage of the beautiful landscape in the Rocky Mountains while either hiking or camping. I love learning about native ecosystems and being as self-sustainable as possible.
